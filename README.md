# RNAseqForBiologists2018
RNA Club meets NGSchool: Tutorial of RNA-seq Data Analysis for Biologists

## Goal of this tutorial

Our goal in this tutorial is to bring a summary of the RNA-seq experiment into R/Bioconductor for visualization and statistical testing. We want to visualize the relationships between the samples (within and across conditions), and then we want to perform statistical tests to find which genes are changing their expression. Finally, we want to perform a functional analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEG) between selected conditions.
